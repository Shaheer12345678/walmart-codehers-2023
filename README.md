# Walmart CodeHers 2023 (Walmart Global Tech)

**Platform:** HackerRank / Unstop  
**Audience:** Women in engineering students (India/Canada/US)  
**Format:** Multiple rounds of **algorithmic & data-structure** problems; code efficiency + correctness via automated tests.

This folder contains a representative problem: **Dynamic Inventory Rebalancing Simulation** (Python).
It mirrors the kind of optimization/greedy/dp thinking you would demonstrate in timed rounds.

- `src/inventory_rebalancer.py` — CLI tool that simulates demand at stores and rebalances from warehouses with minimal cost.
- `src/test_inventory_rebalancer.py` — Tiny sanity tests to show usage.
- No UI/UX; focus is logic, complexity, and clean code.
